## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED (December 25, 2025)

### 1. Bullets Not Retrieved During Generation  RESOLVED
**Problem**: Agents call LLM directly without retrieving procedural memory

**Solution Implemented** (December 25, 2025):
-  Created bullet_formatter.py for formatting bullets into LLM context
-  Rewrote LeftBrain.process() to retrieve bullets (k=8, min_conf=0.5)
-  Rewrote RightBrain.process() to retrieve bullets (k=12, min_conf=0.3)
-  Updated BicameralMind to pass procedural memory to agents
-  Added config settings (k_bullets, min_bullet_confidence)
-  Track bullet_ids in metadata for outcome recording
-  Created test_bullet_integration.py (all tests passing)

**Result**: Bullets now properly retrieved and injected into LLM context during generation

### 2. Hemisphere Assignment Based on Executor, Not Content  RESOLVED
**Problem**: Bullets assigned to hemisphere based on which agent executed, not insight cognitive style

**Solution Implemented** (December 25, 2025):
-  Implemented staging area (Phase 4.5 complete)
-  Meta-bullets installed (25 patterns: 11 left, 12 right, 2 ambiguous)
-  HemisphereClassifier classifies based on cognitive style
-  Curator routes insights through classifier
-  High-confidence (>0.85) auto-assigned
-  Low-confidence (<0.7) flagged for manual review
-  Config: staging.auto_assign = true

**Result**: Bullets now classified by content cognitive style, not executor hemisphere

### 3. Questions Not Implemented  RESOLVED (Templates Complete)
**Problem**: Agents never ask clarifying/exploratory questions

**Solution Implemented** (December 25, 2025):
-  Added QUESTION bullet type to BulletType enum
-  Updated bullet_formatter.py to handle QUESTION type
-  Created 16 question template bullets (scripts/install_question_bullets.py)
  - 6 left brain: Binary/categorical questions for disambiguation
  - 7 right brain: Open-ended/exploratory questions
  - 3 meta-heuristics: When to ask questions
-  Bullets installed to procedural memory
-  Agents retrieve question templates via existing retrieval mechanism

**Note**: Question templates now available for retrieval. Explicit question-asking logic in agent response generation deferred (agents use templates as guidance).

### 4. Tool Integration Gaps  RESOLVED (Core Complete, UI Pending)
**Problem**: MCP client exists but not wired to runtime UI

**Solution Status** (December 25, 2025):
-  MCPClient implementation complete (integrations/mcp/mcp_client.py)
-  ToolExecutor with bullet retrieval (integrations/mcp/tool_executor.py)
-  MCPLearningIntegration complete (integrations/mcp/mcp_learning_integration.py)
  - Retrieves bullets before tool execution
  - Generates execution traces
  - Learns from tool results
  - Records outcomes for bullets
-  End-to-end tool -> learning flow working
-  FastAPI UI integration deferred (Phase 5)

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES (Always Enforce)

### Memory
-  Procedural memory MUST use bullets, NEVER summaries
-  Hemispheres MUST remain separate (no direct overwrites)
-  Shared memory ONLY via validated promotion
-  Hemisphere assignment based on CONTENT, not executor (in progress)

### Learning
-  Outcomes update SCORES (helpful/harmful)
-  Ticks gate REFLECTION DEPTH, not scoring
-  Add incrementally, NEVER rewrite wholesale
-  Start QUARANTINED, promote with validation
-  Bullets retrieved during generation (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

### Architecture
-  Left = Pattern continuity (exploit)
-  Right = Pattern violation (explore)
-  Meta-controller = Mode switching, NOT execution
-  No anthropomorphism (ticks = emotions)
